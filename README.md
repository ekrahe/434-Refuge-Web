#434-Refuge-Web
##Overview
Refuge is a mobile and web service created to address problems of the European Migrant Crisis.
Our web application has been built to service NGOs, and allows them to create events, view them on a calendar, and send push notifications to refugees.
Those actions service the mobile application, which is used by refugees to search for aid in their area by entering a term and being presented with a list of created events.
The website is at least temporarily accessible at 54.172.72.146/event_homepage.php.

##Usage
This web application works across all web browsers though Google chrome is the most recommended.

The icon is our own but the project took many web searches to get where it is.
